    "### Goal\n",
    "The objective of this article that follows a first one is to learn graphs from scratch using a visualizing tool called \n",
    " ipycytoscape.  In order to get into graphs I had made the point that it is better starting by visualizing because an image is worth a million words and also a million equations.\n",
    "A small graph was built in the first part, and we made little by little some modifications to the graph showing how ipycytoscape can be used to get an idea of how data can be presented in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Links\n",
    "ipycytoscape project: https://github.com/QuantStack/ipycytoscape\n",
    "The first medium article is already part of the example of iypcytoscape.\n",

    "### The project\n",
    "You have to imagine that you are a coder that is ultimately in charge of creating a GUI that shows the German rail net in an interactive way showing different kinds of information for the operators to be able to take decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a coder after having read the first article you are at a point where you might be facing the following situations:\n",
    "- A friend told you that visualizing graphs in notebooks is not the way to go: I assure you that you will be able to tell him \"voilà\". (\"here you are\" in French)\n",
    "- Another friend might have told you that in order to really work in python with graphs you better start digging into Networkx. Well you might tell him that a pic is worth a thousand words, and for what it takes, a pic is worth a thousand equations. You will be able to jump from visualizing with ipycytoscape to Networkx in a moreal natural way, better than the other way around, that is my whole point with this series of articles.\n",
    "- And yet other friend told you that in any case jupyter is not meant for a production environment, and then you might mention Jupyter Hub to serve apps throughout an entire organization and see his reaction."
